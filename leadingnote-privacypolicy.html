    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 15, 2024</p>
    <p>We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our app. The short answer: we don't collect, use, or share any of your personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal information, usage data, or analytics. It operates entirely on your device without requiring internet connectivity or accessing external servers.</p>

    <p>The app is designed to function offline. It does not connect to the internet, transmit data, or communicate with any external services.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions for premium features are handled securely through Apple’s StoreKit. We do not process or store any payment information. All transactions are managed by Apple, and you can review their privacy policy for more details.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Since our app does not connect to the internet, it does not integrate with any third-party services that might collect or process your data.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We don’t collect any personal data.</li>

    <p>Our app is safe for all ages and does not collect any data from users, including children under 13.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect or use your data, this Privacy Policy is unlikely to change. However, if updates are made, we will reflect the changes in this document and update the date at the top.</p>
