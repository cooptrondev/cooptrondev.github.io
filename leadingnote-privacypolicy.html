    <h1>Leading Note: Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 9, 2025</p>
    <p>We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect limited usage data to help us improve the app experience. This includes information about how you interact with features and content inside the app (e.g., which pieces are accessed or bookmarked).</p>
    <p>This data is collected via <strong>Amplitude</strong>, a privacy-conscious analytics service. It does <strong>not</strong> include personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or payment details.</p>

    <h2>2. Internet Connectivity</h2>
    <p>The app connects to the internet to:</p>

        <li>Send anonymized usage data to Amplitude for analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app does not require a constant internet connection. Most functionality is available offline after content is downloaded.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions for premium features are handled securely through Apple’s StoreKit. We do not process or store any payment information. All transactions are managed by Apple. You can review their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Amplitude</strong>: For anonymized usage analytics. See <a href="https://amplitude.com/privacy" target="_blank">Amplitude's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong>: For managing subscriptions and in-app purchases.</li>
        <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (S3)</strong>: To host downloadable content like sheet music and recordings.</li>
        <li><strong>Fly.io</strong>: To serve downloadable content through our API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or store your personal data (e.g., name, email).</li>
        <li>All usage data collected is anonymized and used solely to improve the app.</li>
        <li>Downloaded content and your app preferences (like bookmarks or notes) are stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data, please contact us.</p>
